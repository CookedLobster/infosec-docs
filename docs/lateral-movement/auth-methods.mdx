## Kerberos

**`Kerberos Authentication`** is the default **Authentication Protocol** for any recent Version of Windows. Users to Log into a Service using Kerberos will be assigned **Tickets.** **Tickets** act as a proof of a Previous Authentication. 

Users with **Tickets** can be present them to a Service to Demonstrate they have already Authenticated into the Network before and therefore enabled to use it.


```batch
:: Kerberos
88/TCP
```

### How to Authenticate with Kerberos?



<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="one" label="Server Authentication"> 
    <div style={{color: 'white'}}>

```
  ┌───────────────────┐
  | Domain Controller |
  └───────────────────┘

  └───────────────────┘        └───────────────────┘
```

```batch
:: [1] Client Requests an Authentication Ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC)
:: [2] The KDC Verifies the Credentials and Sends back an Encrypted TGT and Session Key
:: [3] The TGT is Encrypted using the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) Secret Key
:: [4] The Client stores the TGT and when it expires the Local Session Manager will request another TGT
```

  <TabItem value="two" label="Client Request">
    <div style={{color: 'red'}}>

```
  ┌───────────────────┐
  | Domain Controller |
  └───────────────────┘

            |
            |
  ┌───────────────────┐        ┌───────────────────┐ 
  |      Client       | ─────  |      Server       |
  └───────────────────┘        └───────────────────┘
```

<br/>

```batch
:: [1] The Client sends the current TGT to the TGS with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the Resource the Client wants to access
:: [2] The KDC Verifies the TGT of the User and that the User has access to the Service
:: [3] TGS sends a Valid Session Key for the Service to the Client
:: [4] Client forwards the Session key to the Service to prove the User has access, and the Service Grants Access.
```

## NetNTLM

:::caution The Described Process applies when using a `Domain Account`

If a **Local Account** is used, the Server can verify the Response to the **Challenge** itself without Requiring Interaction with the Domain Controller since it has the Password Hash stored locally on its **SAM**.

:::

<br/>

**NetNTLM** works using a **`Challenge-Response`** Mechanism.


```batch
:: [1] The Client Sends an Authentication Request to the Server they want to Access
:: [2] The Server generates a Random Number and sends it as a Challenge to the Client
:: [3] The Client combines their NTLM Password Hash with the Challenge to Generate a Response to the Challenge and sends it back to the Server for Verification
:: [4] The Server forwards the Challenge and the response to the Domain Controller for Verification
:: [5] The Domain Controller uses the Challenge to recalculate the Response and compares it to the Original Response sent by the Client. 
:: [5.1] If they both match, the Client is Authenticated. Otherwise, access is Denied. The Authentication result is sent back to the Server
:: [6] The Server forwards the Authentication result to the Client
```
